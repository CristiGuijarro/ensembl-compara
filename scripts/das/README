Using a compara database as a DAS source
========================================

Here is a small document that describe how you can set up a DAS server
to display whole genome alignment as DAS features.
We have used ProServer version 1 DAS server and tested the display on
Ensembl website DAS client only.

1. Make sure you have the Ensembl core and compara code installed.

Look at this page for all the details
http://www.ensembl.org/info/software/api_installation.html

2. Download ProServer

From http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/proserver/
Download the version 1. The current setup has not being tested on
version 2.

3. Make sure to have the CPAN Config::IniFiles module installed. If not get
it here
http://search.cpan.org/~wadg/Config-IniFiles-2.38/IniFiles.pm

4. Include ProServer/lib and in your PERL5LIB environment variable and
ProServer/eg in your PATH environment variable

5. modify ProServer1/eg/proserver so it does not run in tainted mode

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -wT

to

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

6. Create your configuration file, taking compara_das.ini as an example
or by looking at perldoc Bio::Das::ProServer::SourceAdaptor::compara

7. Start your DAS server 

ensembl-compara/scripts/das/start_server.sh das_conf.ini

8. To stop the DAS server 

ensembl-compara/scripts/das/kill_server.sh das_conf.ini
