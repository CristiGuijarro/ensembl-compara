# ------------------[Running MCL Family pipeline]-------------
#
# Dependencies:
#
# 0) mysql 5.1 or higher
# 1) fresh ensembl-hive and ensembl-compara CVS checkouts
# 2) blastp, mcl and mafft (external executables)
# 3) bioperl with Abel's changes for loading of Uniprot sequences [this is an unwanted dependency]
#
#
# The new MCL Family pipeline is initialized from ensembl-compara/scripts/family/family_pipeline.conf .
# Please edit this file to reflect the current state of things:
#
# 1) $release number
# 2) your $email address (to get the completion notification)
# 3) $cvs_root_dir (your CVS modules may not live in ~/work)
# 4) location of blastp, mcl and mafft
# 5) version of blastp
# 6) connection parameters of all the databases
# 7) blastp/mcl running parameters (may considerably influence the resource requirements!)
# 8) resource requirements for this particular run
#
# Then run the pipeline initialization command:
#
# time init_pipeline.pl -conf family_pipeline.conf
#
# It will prompt you to run the beekeeper.pl with the URL generated from your connection data.
# DON'T FORGET to use '-lifespan 1200' on the beekeeper, otherwise the benefit of using the long queue will be lost.
# 
# rel.57+:  init_pipeline.pl execution took 8m45;   pipeline execution took 100hours (4.2 x days-and-nights) including queue waiting
#
# Note: family_idmap analysis failed 4 times as part of pipeline, but ran successfully via runWorker.pl

#
## Please remember that both mapping_session and stable_id_history will have to be MERGED in an intelligent way, and not just written over.
