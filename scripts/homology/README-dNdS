11. calculate dN and dS values
    --------------------------

Once each homology relationship is loaded to the compara database and only then we can calculate the
dN and dS value.
So far we only do that for human/mouse, human/rat, mouse/rat and elegans/briggsae.

We do that for all of them at once. So have all the paired species homologies loaded in compara.


 mkdir -p $WORKDIR/dNdS_20_1/homology_ids_dNdS $WORKDIR/dNdS_20_1/homology_ids_in \
 $WORKDIR/dNdS_20_1/homology_ids_out
 cd $WORKDIR/dNdS_20_1

Get all the homology_ids for which as dN, dS calculation is required
e.g. for human/mouse, taxon_id 9606 and 10090 repectively

echo "select hm1.homology_id from homology_member hm1,homology_member hm2,member m1,member m2 where hm1.homology_id=hm2.homology_id and hm1.member_id=m1.member_id and hm2.member_id=m2.member_id and m1.taxon_id=9606 and m2.taxon_id=10090;"|mysql -h ecs2 -P3364 -u ensro ensembl_compara_22_1|grep -v homology_id > 9606_10090.homology_ids

an so on for 9606/10116, 10090/10116 and 6239/6238

echo "select hm1.homology_id from homology_member hm1,homology_member hm2,member m1,member m2 where hm1.homology_id=hm2.homology_id and hm1.member_id=m1.member_id and hm2.member_id=m2.member_id and m1.taxon_id=9606 and m2.taxon_id=10116;"|mysql -h ecs2 -P3364 -u ensro ensembl_compara_22_1|grep -v homology_id > 9606_10116.homology_ids

echo "select hm1.homology_id from homology_member hm1,homology_member hm2,member m1,member m2 where hm1.homology_id=hm2.homology_id and hm1.member_id=m1.member_id and hm2.member_id=m2.member_id and m1.taxon_id=10090 and m2.taxon_id=10116;"|mysql -h ecs2 -P3364 -u ensro ensembl_compara_22_1|grep -v homology_id > 10090_10116.homology_ids

echo "select hm1.homology_id from homology_member hm1,homology_member hm2,member m1,member m2 where hm1.homology_id=hm2.homology_id and hm1.member_id=m1.member_id and hm2.member_id=m2.member_id and m1.taxon_id=6239 and m2.taxon_id=6238;"|grep -v homology_id > 6239_6238.homology_ids


To calculate the dN, dS we use ensembl-compara/scripts/homology/generate_dN_dS.pl. 

check how many homology_ids, we have

cat *.homology_ids|wc -l
     71704

we usually send ~200 jobs, we can submit roughly 356 at once. (71704/200 = 355.5)

cd homology_ids_in
cat ../*.homology_ids|split -l 356 -a 3 - homology_ids.
ls |cat -n|sed "s/\./ /"|while read i j k;do mv $j.$k $j.$i;done

submit the one job

echo '/nfs/acari/abel/src/ensembl_main/ensembl-compara/scripts/homology/generate_dN_dS.pl -host ecs2e -dbname ensembl_compara_20_1 -id_file homology_ids.${LSB_JOBINDEX} -dir /ecs2/work4/compara_abel_cara/genepair/dNdS/19_2/homology_ids_dNdS'|bsub -JdNdS"[1]" -o ../homology_ids_out/homology_ids.%I.out

If it is working fine send the others

[...] -JdNdS"[2-200]" [...]

check the output files in ../homology_ids_out to see whether all jobs finished well. 

Load dNdS in compara. No proper script for that yet...:(

cd ../homology_ids_dNdS

The data ouput looks like that

gunzip -c homology_ids.1.codeml.gz | head -2
81435 PIP ENSMUSP00000053262    ENSRNOP00000031446      652.9   262.1   0.06185 0.18269 0.33854 -1558.224

homology_id type stable_id stable_id N S dN dS dN/dS LnL

check for FAILED codeml and resubmit them

gunzip -c *.codeml.gz | grep FAILED|awk '{print $1}' > ../homology_ids_in/homology_ids.201

re-bsub with JOBINDEX -> 201

we are just interested by homology_id, dN and dS

gunzip -c *.codeml.gz|grep -v FAILED|awk '{print "update homology set dn="$7",ds="$8",n="$5",s="$6",lnl="$10" where homology_id="$1";"}' > update_dnds.sql

mysql -h ecs2e -u ensadmin -pxxxxxx ensembl_compara_20_1 < update_dnds.sql

Deterining the median cut-off (still need to find a way to store in the compara db, in meta table probably)

mysql> select count(*) from homology where stable_id like "9606_10090%";
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    19374 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.20 sec)

if count is even number the median is the average of (19374/2) 9687th value and the 9688th value

mysql> select ds from homology where stable_id like "9606_10090%" order by ds asc limit 9686,2;
+---------+
| ds      |
+---------+
| 0.62996 |
| 0.63008 |
+---------+
2 rows in set (0.40 sec)

so median is (0.62996+0.63008)/2 = 0.63002

if count id odd number

mysql> select count(*) from homology where stable_id like "9606_10090%";
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    19373 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.20 sec)

Then the median is the ((19373-1)/2) 9686th value

mysql> select ds from homology where stable_id like "9606_10090%" order by ds asc limit 9686,1;
+---------+
| ds      |
+---------+
| 0.62996 |
+---------+
1 row in set (0.45 sec)

For the web display we then apply a cut-off of 2*median. So let's say the median is 0.63002,
the cut-off will be 1.26004 (0.63002*2). So for an homology_id the ds>1.26004 for the paired species
considered, dS and dN values are not considered reliable and not displayed (even though being stored in 
the database)

To set the cut-off in the db,

update homology set threshold_on_ds=1.26004 where stable_id like "9606_10090%";
