    # 0. Loading of a fresh ncbi_taxonomy database is now done by initializing and running a small Hive pipeline.
            Make sure you have ensembl, ensembl-hive and ensembl-compara checked out into $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR
    
    # 1. edit $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/taxonomy/ensembl_aliases.sql to ensembl aliases if needed.

            $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/taxonomy/ensembl_aliases.sql needs to be updated
            as new species are integrated into Ensembl.

            The basic rule for "ensembl common name" is to use "genbank common name"
            or any of "common name" available. If they don't exist you are free to invent one.
            This is used in the download page:
                http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/download.html

            The other source of info is here:
                http://www.intlgenome.org/viewDatabase.cfm

    # 2. edit ensembl-compara/scripts/taxonomy/web_name_patches.sql to patch web names if needed.

            For "ensembl alias name", it is used at the top of the web page of each species,
            when it says e.g. "e!EnsemblHuman" or "e!EnsemblMouse".
            This should be agreed with the web team or just take the one they have chosen from the pre site.

        # 3. initialize the pipeline (make sure you have deleted the previous version of the database or are using another suffix):

    init_pipeline.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::ImportNCBItaxonomy_conf -password <your_password> -ensembl_cvs_root_dir <path_to_your_ensembl_cvs_root>

        # 4. run the pipeline:

    beekeeper.pl ... (specific command line(s) will be printed by init_pipeline.pl)

        # 5. clean up the target database by removing hive tables:

    mysql .... (specific connection parameters printed by init_pipeline.pl) -e 'call drop_hive_tables'
