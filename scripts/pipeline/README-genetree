For now, the genetree process is an add-on to the homology pipeline.
Please start reading README-homology first.

# 1- Load the NCBI taxonomy data 
#    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# These instructions are in the README-homology file as of ensembl v40
# 
# Ideally this should be a job by itself in the pipeline but for now,
# it's done by hand :)
#
# All instructions to do it are in
# ensembl-compara/scripts/taxonomy/README-taxonomy


# 2- Create the other gene tree-related tables in the database
#   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# These tables are already in the main ensembl-compara/sql/table.sql
# file as of ensembl v40.
#
# $ mysql -hcompara1 -uensadmin -pensembl abel_compara_tree_41 \
#   < ensembl-compara/sql/protein_tree.sql
#
# This will create 3 tables
# protein_tree_node
# protein_tree_member
# protein_tree_tag


3- Copy and modify the compara-hive config file
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may need to change the database names, port, dbnames, and the
paths to the 'hive_output_dir' and 'fasta_dir'. Note that these dirs
must exist.

  $ cd $BASEDIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline
  $ cp compara-hive-homology.conf.example my_compara.conf
  <editor> my_compara.conf

 { TYPE => GENE_TREE,
    'cluster_params' => 
        '{'
        .'species_set=>[3,4,5,7,10,11,13,14,15,16,17,18,22,24,25,26,27,28,29,31,32,33,34,35,36],'
        .'brh=>1,'
        .'all_best=>0,'
        .'bsr_threshold=>0.33'
        .'}',
     'breakcluster_params' => 
        '{'
        .'species_set=>[3,4,5,7,10,11,13,14,15,16,17,18,22,24,25,26,27,28,29,31,32,33,34,35,36],'
        .'bsr_threshold_increase=>0.1'
        .'}',
    'max_gene_count' => 2000,
    'species_tree_file' => 
        '{'
        .'species_tree_file=>'
                .'"/ecs2/work2/avilella/hive/avilella_compara_homology_40/'
                .'compara_encode_species_tree_40_mfurc.nh"'
        .'}',
    'rap_jar_file' => '/ecs2/work2/avilella/bin/rap.jar'
  },

One example of the species_tree_file can be found in
ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/species_tree.rap


4- Create the species tree file 
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An annotated phylogenetic tree file representing the species in the
compara DB and their relative distances is required for the final rap
tree building stage. The file must be in Nexus (.nh) format, with all
levels enclosed with a '()ROOT:0.0;' level. A curated nh file
containing the ensembl species is available at
ensembl_compara/scripts/pipeline/species_tree.rap

An unweighted file based on the NCBI taxonomy can be generated using
compara's taxonTreeTool.pl as follows;

 $ $BASEDIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/taxonomy/taxonTreeTool.pl \
   -url mysql://ensro@compara1:3306/abel_compara_tree_41 \
   -taxa_compara -mini \
   | tail n 1

The file that is to be used for rap should be configured in the
'species_tree_file' setting of my_compara.GENE_TREE.



5- Run the configure scripts
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The loadGeneTreeSystem script creates the analysis entries for the
processing system, and creates both the dataflow rule and the analysis
control rules.  It also initializes the analysis_stats row for each
analysis.  These rows hold information like batch_size, hive_capacity,
and run-time stats that the Hive's Queen will update.

These scripts may give you warnings if the output directories are not
available or if it's unable to connect to core databases.

 $ cd $BASEDIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline
 $ ./loadGeneTreeSystem.pl -conf my_compara.conf

At this point the system is ready to run using the beekeeper.pl script
as explained in the README-homology
