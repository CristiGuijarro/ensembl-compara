This document is a first attempt to describe the different steps that the compara
release coordination has to overlook to hopefully have a successful production cycle.

1. Once the release coordinator has sent the mail for declaration of intention,
ask the other members of compara group (or related) what they intend to produce.
Sometimes, you have to wait a bit that gene builders do their declaration first
to know what compara will need to produce and also potential schema changes.

For orthologues and family, ask Jessica (jessica@ebi.ac.uk)
For paralogues, ask Dan Andrews (dta@sanger.ac.uk)
For whole genome alignments and synteny ask Javier (jherrero@ebi.ac.uk)
or Abel (abel@ebi.ac.uk)

2. Mail the compara declaration of intention to ensembl-admin

3. Usually the protein/gene compara production and whole genome alignments (WGA)
production are done separately in 2 different databases, and even MySQL instances.

A lot of the WGA data released the month before is just "recycled". Have a database
copy of the latest compara release on your chosen MySQL instance, and renamed for
the new release (e.g. copy ensembl_compara_30 to ensembl_compara_31)

Delete none WGA related data (e.g. homology, family, taxon...)
Delete out of date WGA.

4. IMPORTANT: making sure there is no conflict between protein and WGA production
on

genome_db_id
method_link_species_set_id

Some of these can be recycled. At the moment, the only way to avoid conflicts is
that the persons in production communicated/exchange/agree on the common genome_db_id and
method_link_species_set_id to be used.

Usually method_link_species_set_id range is as follow
    1 to 10000 WGA
10001 to 20000 Synteny
20001 tp 30000 Homology
30001 to 40000 Family

Inside the WGA production, avoid genomic_align_block_id and genomic_align_id conflicts
between different method_link_species_set production.

5. Merging of protein/gene production and WGA production. Each production is in a database, and both databases must be on the same MySQL instance.

There is no script for the following now (we should have one though), the protein/gene
data is moved to the WGA database by a serie of insert/select from and to the following tables.

homology
homology_member
family
family_member
member
sequence
taxon
peptide_align_feature (this one take a while)

by a serie of insert ignore/select from and to the following tables.

method_link
method_link_species_set

A potential check script to write should check that both genome_db tables are consistent.

6. Once the database is merge, run the heathchecks to spot potential conflicts
see ensembl-compara/docs/healthchecks.txt
